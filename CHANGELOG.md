    * continue using counter_culture 1.12.0

    * avoid triggering further updates on the same model in `after_create`; simply set the attribute in `before_create` instead

Improvements:
  - Address deprecation warning when enabling paper_trail touch in paper_trail version 9.0
  - Address `Arel` deprecation warnings in Rails 5.2

Changes:
  - Test against Ruby 2.2 through 2.5, Rails 3.2 through 5.2
  - Don't test Rails 3.2 through 4.1 against Ruby 2.4 or 2.5 as those versions of Rails will not work with those versions of Ruby
  - Avoid various deprecation warnings being triggered in the test

## 1.9.1 (March 1, 2018)

Bugfixes:
  - Address an edge-case test regression caused by Rails 5.1.5 that was causing counts to be off when saving changes from an `after_create` callback

Improvements:
  - Quote all table names to work correctly with PostgreSQL schemata

  - Support for creating `paper_trail` versions when counters change

## 1.6.2 (April 26, 2017)

## 1.6.0 (April 24, 2017)

Improvements:
  - Keeps counts updated correctly when using the paranoia gem and restoring soft-deleted records

## 1.5.1 (April 17, 2017)

## 1.3.0 (February 21, 2017)
Removed features:
  - Removed support for `has_one`; this did not work properly. If you need this, consider adding the `counter_culture` call on the model with the `belongs_to` instead.

## 1.2.0 (February 21, 2017)

New features:
  - Add support for custom timestamp column with `touch` option

## 1.1.1 (January 13, 2017)

Improvements:
  - Support for `has_one` associations

## 1.0.0 (November 15, 2016)

Breaking changes:
  - By default, counter_culture will now update counts inside the same transaction that triggered it. In older versions, counter cache updates happened outside of that transaction. To preserve the old behavior, use the new [`execute_after_commit` option](README.md#executing-counter-cache-updates-after-commit).

## 0.2.3 (October 18, 2016)

Improvements:
  - When running `fix_counts` on a table, wrap each batch in a transaction because that is faster on large tables.

## 0.2.2 (July 11, 2016)

Bugfixes:
  - Use `ActiveSupport.on_load` for better Rails 5 compatibility (see [rails/rails#23589](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/23589))
