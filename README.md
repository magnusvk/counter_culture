# counter_culture

Turbo-charged counter caches for your Rails app. Huge improvements over the Rails standard counter caches:

* Updates counter cache when values change, not just when creating and destroying 
* Supports counter caches through multiple levels of relations
* Supports dynamic column names, making it possible to split up the counter cache for different types of objects
* Executes counter updates after the commit, avoiding [deadlocks](http://mina.naguib.ca/blog/2010/11/22/postgresql-foreign-key-deadlocks.html)
* Can keep a running count, or a running total

## Installation

Add counter_culture to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'counter_culture', '~> 0.1.7'
```

Then run ```bundle update ```

## Database Schema

You will need to manually create the necessary columns for all counter caches. Use code like the following in your migration:
```ruby
add_column :categories, :products_count, :integer, :null => false, :default => 0
```
It is important to make the column ```NOT NULL``` and set a default of zero for this gem to work correctly.

If you are adding counter caches to existing data, you must [manually populate their values](#manually-populating-counter-cache-values).

## Usage

### Simple counter-cache

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :category
  counter_culture :category
end

class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :products
end
```

Now, the ```Category``` model will keep an up-to-date counter-cache in the ```products_count``` column of the ```categories``` table.

### Multi-level counter-cache

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :sub_category
  counter_culture [:sub_category, :category]
end

class SubCategory < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :products
  belongs_to :category
end

class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :sub_categories
end
```

Now, the ```Category``` model will keep an up-to-date counter-cache in the ```products_count``` column of the ```categories``` table. This will work with any number of levels.

If you want to have a counter-cache for each level of your hierarchy, then you must add a separate counter cache for each level.  In the above example, if you wanted a count of products for each category and sub_category you would change the Product class to:

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :sub_category
  counter_culture [:sub_category, :category]
  counter_culture [:sub_category]
end
```

### Customizing the column name

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :category
  counter_culture :category, :column_name => "products_counter_cache"
end

class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :products
end
```

Now, the ```Category``` model will keep an up-to-date counter-cache in the ```products_counter_cache``` column of the ```categories``` table. This will also work with multi-level counter caches.

### Dynamic column name

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :category
  counter_culture :category, :column_name => Proc.new {|model| "#{model.product_type}_count" }
  # attribute product_type may be one of ['awesome', 'sucky']
end

class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :products
end
```

Now, the ```Category``` model will keep two up-to-date counter-caches in the ```awesome_count``` and ```sucky_count``` columns of the ```categories``` table. Products with type ```'awesome'``` will affect only the ```awesome_count```, while products with type ```'sucky'``` will affect only the ```sucky_count```. This will also work with multi-level counter caches.

### Conditional counter cache

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :category
  counter_culture :category, :column_name => Proc.new {|model| model.special? ? 'special_count' : nil }
end

class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :products
end
```

Now, the ```Category``` model will keep the counter cache in ```special_count``` up-to-date. Only products where ```special?``` returns true will affect the special_count.

### Totaling instead of counting

Instead of keeping a running count, you may want to automatically track a running total.
In that case, the target counter will change by the value in the totaled field instead of changing by exactly 1 each time.
Use the ```:delta_column``` option to specify that the counter should change by the value of a specific field in the counted object.
For example, suppose the Product model has a table field named ```number_of_reviews```, and you want to keep a running
total of the number of reviews for all the products in the Category model's ```product_reviews_count``` field:

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :category
  counter_culture :category, :column_name => 'product_reviews_count', :delta_column => 'number_of_reviews'
end

class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :products
end
```

Now, the ```Category``` model will keep the counter cache in ```product_reviews_count``` up-to-date.
The value in the counter cache will be the sum of the ```number_of_reviews``` values in each of the associated Product records.

### Dynamically over-writing affected foreign keys

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :category
  counter_culture :category, :foreign_key_values => 
      Proc.new {|category_id| [category_id, Category.find_by_id(category_id).try(:parent_category).try(:id)] }
end

class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :parent_category, :class_name => 'Category', :foreign_key => 'parent_id'
  has_many :children, :class_name => 'Category', :foreign_key => 'parent_id'
  
  has_many :products
end
```

Now, the ```Category``` model will keep an up-to-date counter-cache in the ```products_count``` column of the ```categories``` table. Each product will affect the counts of both its immediate category and that category's parent. This will work with any number of levels.

### Manually populating counter cache values

You will sometimes want to populate counter-cache values from primary data. This is required when adding counter-caches to existing data. It is also recommended to run this regularly (at BestVendor, we run it once a week) to catch any incorrect values in the counter caches.

```ruby
Product.counter_culture_fix_counts
# will automatically fix counts for all counter caches defined on Product

Product.counter_culture_fix_counts :except => :category
# will automatically fix counts for all counter caches defined on Product, except for the :category relation

Product.counter_culture_fix_counts :only => :category
# will automatically fix counts only on the :category relation on Product

# :except and :only also accept arrays of one level relations
# if you want to fix counts on a more than one level relation you need to use convention below:

Product.counter_culture_fix_counts :only => [[:subcategory, :category]]
# will automatically fix counts only on the two-level [:subcategory, :category] relation on Product

# :except and :only also accept arrays
```

```counter_culture_fix_counts``` returns an array of hashes of all incorrect values for debugging purposes. The hashes have the following format:

```ruby
{ :entity => which model the count was fixed on,
  :id => the id of the model that had the incorrect count,
  :what => which column contained the incorrect count,
  :wrong => the previously saved, incorrect count,
  :right => the newly fixed, correct count }
```

```counter_culture_fix_counts``` is optimized to minimize the number of queries and runs very quickly.

#### Handling dynamic column names

Manually populating counter caches with dynammic column names requires additional configuration:

```ruby
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :category
  counter_culture :category, 
      :column_name => Proc.new {|model| "#{model.product_type}_count" },
      :column_names => {
          ["products.product_type = ?", 'awesome'] => 'awesome_count',
          ["products.product_type = ?", 'sucky'] => 'sucky_count'
      }
  # attribute product_type may be one of ['awesome', 'sucky']
end
```

#### Handling over-written, dynamic foreign keys

Manually populating counter caches with dynamicall over-written foreign keys (```:foreign_key_values``` option) is not supported. You will have to write code to handle this case yourself.

#### Polymorphic associations

counter_culture currently does *not* support polymorphic associations. Check [this issue](https://github.com/bestvendor/counter_culture/issues/4) for progress and alternatives.
